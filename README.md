# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
### Purpose
In this analysis we used our data analysis skills in SQL to determine the number of retiring employees per title and then identify the employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. 

The purpose of this was to help prepare Bobby's manager at Pewlett Hackard for the "silver tsunami" when a number of current employees entire retirement.

## Results
First, there is the ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram). This diagram shows the relations between different aspects of the data to help with the analysis going forward.
